							<h2>Profile</h2>

						<div class="yui-u">
							<p class="enlarge">
								I am a hardworking student currently working to complete and earn a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Ball State University. I am taking and have taken various courses in computer science including data related courses such as Data Mining and Data Analytics. Some of my work experience includes working in retail and customer service.

								<h2>Text Adventure</h2>
								<p>The final project for the first computer science class I took, we were to create our own text adventure game. I created a dungeon maze where the user could pick what direction they wanted to go in. If characters went into certain rooms, they could decide if they wanted to look around, and there were items that they could find. The overall goal was to find the keys that would let them exit the dungeon, and I even included a couple of different endings (one where the user finds the treasure and escapes, and one where the user escapes without the treasure). This project was created in JES.</p>

									<h2>Student Record Application</h2>
									<p>As a final project for one of the early Computer Science courses, we created a student record application. The requirements for this application included being able to allow the user to create and add a new student record, remove a student record, access any and all existing student records, and search for a student record by name or student ID. When adding courses to a student's records, the user could enter the course, number of credits the course was worth, along with the grade that the student got. Then based off of all the grades that one student has, the system could calculate the student's GPA. The application was created in Java.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="talent">
									<h2>Wikipedia Data Searcher</h2>
									<p>For this project, one partner and I were to create a software application that pulls live data from Wikipedia. The data we were specifically looking for was the most recent editors along with the most active editors of an article on Wikipedia. In the first iteration, the main focus was to get the software to where it can pull and display the data. In the second iteration, we were also tasked with creating a graphical user interface that can display the results. The application was created in Java and also used Java FX.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="talent">
									<br>
									<h2>Restraunt Order</h2>
									<p>For a final project in an advanced programming class, students were organized into groups of four where we had to create our own non-trivial piece of software. The project took place over three iterations, and we were to have some executable software at each release. My group decided to do a restraunt order system where a customer could select what food they wanted to order, and as they selected what they would want, the software would add up the prices until the customer was ready to check out. Then not only does it display their total, but it will give the option to add a tip, and if the customer enter's an amount (could be a percentage or specific amount), it will recalculate a final total with the tip added. The software was created using Java and Java FX.</p>
